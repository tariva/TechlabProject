# Tools and Stack

## DSPy.ai

DSPy is a Python framework that helps improve and fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using programmatic optimization. It allows users to design structured, modular workflows for prompting or refining models efficiently. Instead of manual prompt engineering, DSPy uses concepts like program synthesis and algorithmic prompting to achieve desired outputs.

- Key Features:
Declarative Prompting: Define how you want the model to behave instead of tweaking prompts repeatedly.
Programmatic Optimization: Automatically adjust prompts or instructions to optimize model performance.
Reusable Modules: Combine tasks in a modular way for building workflows.

- Use Cases:
Automating LLM-based workflows such as Q&A systems, summarization pipelines, and text generation tasks.
Fine-tuning models or optimizing performance without the need for massive manual datasets.
Applications that need robust, programmatically validated model outputs in production (e.g., decision trees, policy generation).

## Pydantic-ai

Pydantic-AI is an extension or enhancement to the Pydantic library, which is widely used for data validation in Python. It integrates with LLMs to validate, structure, and enforce schema on natural language outputs.

- Key Features:
Model-Agnostic: Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, Groq, and Mistral models. New models can be added via a simple interface.
Type Safety: Enforce structured responses using Pydantic models, ensuring output adheres to predefined schemas.
Tools & Dependency Injection: Allows agents to call external tools dynamically while injecting dependencies in a type-safe manner for modular workflows.

- Use Cases:
Building structured AI agents for customer support, financial services, or data extraction.
Creating agents that call external APIs or tools dynamically, such as database lookups or real-time computation.
Developing production-ready AI apps that require predictable, validated outputs (e.g., JSON schemas).
Handling workflows where dynamic prompts adapt based on user data or dependencies.

## autogen-microsoft

AutoGen is an open-source framework for building AI agent systems with a focus on scalability, modularity, and cross-language support. It simplifies the creation of event-driven, distributed, and resilient agentic applications, allowing agents to collaborate autonomously or with human oversight. AutoGen supports multiple LLMs, tools, and environments, enabling both rapid prototyping and deployment of complex AI workflows.

- Key Features:

Multi-Agent Interaction: Supports coordination among AI agents to solve tasks step-by-step.
Tool Integration: Agents can invoke APIs, code execution environments, and other tools.
Customizable Agents: Define behaviors, roles, and workflows for individual agents.

- Use Cases:

Building systems where agents work together (e.g., one agent plans, another executes).
Automating end-to-end tasks like code generation and debugging, where multiple steps are required.
Collaborative problem-solving environments (e.g., chatbots for customer support that escalate issues to higher-order agents).

## llama.cc

Llama.cc (likely an extension or related ecosystem for LLaMA models) focuses on fine-tuning and deploying LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) models efficiently. It supports distributed training, customization, and inference for Meta’s LLaMA models.

- Key Features:

Fine-Tuning: Tools and frameworks for tuning LLaMA models for specific use cases.
Scalability: Can run on distributed GPUs for large-scale inference or training.

Deploying LLaMA models in resource-constrained environments for real-time inference.
Supporting open-source LLM initiatives for organizations.

## vllm.ai

vLLM (Virtual LLM) is an open-source library designed to enable fast and efficient inference for LLMs. It focuses on optimizing model serving for real-time applications using techniques like continuous batching and efficient memory usage.

- Key Features:
Continuous Batching: Efficiently handles multiple requests by batching dynamically.
Memory Optimization: Reduces memory footprint for faster inference.
High Throughput: Optimized for serving LLMs at scale, making it useful for production-grade deployments.

- Use Cases:
Serving LLMs for real-time APIs (e.g., chatbots, recommendation systems).

### Proposed technology stack

1. Core Framework: AutoGen (Microsoft)
AutoGen serves as the backbone for managing AI agents to handle tasks like processing input data, coordinating workflows, and generating final reports.

Key Capabilities of AutoGen:
Multi-agent orchestration (agents collaborating to process, analyze, and report).
Task decomposition and coordination between agents.
Asynchronous messaging for task distribution.
Integration with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, local LLMs like Llama 2).

2. Agent Architecture
The system will use AutoGen agents to divide and conquer the workflow:

Agents
Data Processing Agent

Takes input from the Security & DNS Analysis tool (raw JSON/XML data).
Prepares and cleans the data for AI processing.
Insights Generator Agent

Uses OpenAI GPT-4 (or local LLMs) to analyze security headers/DNS results and generate:
Summarized findings.
Traffic-light status (Green/Yellow/Red) for clarity.
Actionable recommendations based on predefined knowledge.
Report Generator Agent

Converts the AI-generated insights into a Markdown report.
Uses libraries like mistune for formatting.
Coordinator Agent

Orchestrates the workflow between agents:
Fetch input data → Process → Generate insights → Format and output the report.

Primary Components:
AutoGen: Orchestrates agents and workflows. Manages task decomposition, communication, and multi-agent collaboration.
DSPy.ai:
Provides programmatic optimization for prompting and fine-tuning workflows.
Allows you to define tasks declaratively and programmatically improve prompt performance.
LLM Models:
OpenAI GPT-4 (or any other hosted model): Provides initial insights and recommendations.
Llama 2 (local LLM): Runs locally to verify and validate GPT-generated insights.
How Multi-Model Verification Works:
Initial Insights Generation:

One agent generates recommendations and analyses using GPT-4 (hosted model) or another model.
Cross-Verification Agents:

Second agent (using Llama 2) re-runs the data analysis and compares its insights with GPT-4's outputs.
DSPy.ai ensures prompt consistency and correctness by refining prompts and models programmatically.
Consensus/Validation:

A Validation Agent compares outputs from both models.
If discrepancies arise, DSPy.ai helps refine or re-prompt the models until consensus is achieved.

Processes the input and generates a first draft of insights and recommendations.
Verification Agent (Llama 2):
